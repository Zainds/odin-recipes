    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I first had this pesto grilled cheese sandwich 
        at a small restaurant and immediately went home to duplicate the 
        recipe. I've been making my grilled cheese sandwiches this way ever since!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon softened butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 slices Italian bread</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon prepared pesto sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 slice provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 slices tomato</li>
        <li>1 slice American cheese</li>
    </ul>  

    <h3>Directions</h3>  
    <ol>
        <li>Spread butter on one side of a slice of bread and place it, 
            buttered side down, into a nonstick skillet over medium heat</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 of the pesto sauce on the unbuttered side of the bread. 
            Stack provolone cheese, tomato, and American cheese on top of pesto, in that order</li>
        <li>Spread remaining pesto sauce on second slice of bread. Place it pesto side down 
            onto sandwich in the pan. Butter the top side of bread</li>
        <li>Gently fry sandwich, flipping once, until both sides are golden 
            brown and cheese has melted, about 5 minutes per side</li>
    </ol>
